# Overview

AETHERGRID is a lightweight distributed computing framework that transforms small devices into a collaborative compute cluster.

The system allows a laptop and Raspberry Pi to work together to execute tasks such as:

* distributed AI inference
* Monte Carlo simulations
* particle simulations
* parallel data processing

Unlike large distributed frameworks, AETHERGRID is designed to run on **low-power hardware** such as a Raspberry Pi 3.

The laptop acts as the **control node**, while Raspberry Pi devices operate as **worker nodes**.

# Hardware Setup

Cluster Configuration

Control Node
Laptop
Intel i5-12450H
16GB RAM
Linux (EndeavourOS)

Worker Node
Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
Quad-core ARM Cortex-A53
1GB RAM

Both devices must be connected to the **same WiFi or LAN network**.

The worker node continuously listens for tasks from the laptop.

# Mathematical Model for Distributed Workload

T = \frac{W}{N \cdot C}

Where

T = execution time
W = workload size
N = number of nodes
C = compute capacity of each node

With two nodes (Laptop + Pi), execution time decreases depending on the workload.

---

# Auto Node Discovery

Workers automatically find the control node using UDP broadcast.

This means you **do not need to manually configure IP addresses**.

# Distributed AI Inference

Example: MNIST image classification

Dataset size: 60000 images

```
Laptop → images 1–40000
Pi     → images 40001–60000
```

Both devices perform inference simultaneously.

Results are merged by the laptop.

---

# Monte Carlo Simulation

Example

```
Simulation Trials = 1,000,000

Laptop → 700,000 trials
Pi     → 300,000 trials
```

Results are combined to compute probability estimates.

---

# Cluster Visualization

The cluster includes a simple terminal-based visualization.

Example

```
CLUSTER STATUS

Node            CPU      Tasks
--------------------------------
Laptop          42%      3
RaspberryPi     31%      1
```

This runs directly on the laptop.

---

# Performance Example

Single Laptop

100 seconds

Laptop + Pi

65 seconds

Speed improvement ≈ **1.5×**

This varies depending on workload.

# Installation

Clone repository

```
git clone https://github.com/ckumaran/aethergrid.git
cd aethergrid
```

Install dependencies

```
pip install numpy flask psutil scikit-learn
```

These libraries run fine on Raspberry Pi.

---

# Running the Cluster

Start the control node on the laptop

```
python control_plane/scheduler.py
```

Start the worker node on Raspberry Pi

```
python worker_runtime/worker_node.py
```

The worker will automatically connect to the cluster.

---

# Running Experiments

Example distributed experiment

```
python experiments/run_experiment.py
```

This launches a distributed Monte Carlo simulation.

---

# Running Another Project on Raspberry Pi

Since Raspberry Pi 3 has limited RAM, the worker should run with limited CPU priority.

Run worker node using

```
nice -n 10 python worker_runtime/worker_node.py
```

Or restrict CPU cores

```
taskset -c 0,1 python worker_runtime/worker_node.py
```

This allows another project to run on the Pi simultaneously.

---

# System Limitations

Raspberry Pi 3 has only 1GB RAM.

Recommended workloads

AI inference
Monte Carlo simulations
parallel data processing

Avoid

large neural network training
large datasets exceeding memory

---

# Future Improvements

Possible extensions

distributed reinforcement learning
web-based cluster dashboard
multiple Raspberry Pi nodes
internet-scale distributed clusters
